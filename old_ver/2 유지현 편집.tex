\begin{abstract}
While there are an increasing number of households owning pets, it is challenging for owners who leave home often to take good care of their pets. ‘Petification’ can be a solution for pet owners to know if their pet is doing well by collecting data using sensors mounted on devices used by pets. Pet’s specific information like daily water intake and the amount of feed a pet consumes a day is displayed by a visual graph on the dashboard. Petification provides the status of feed machines and water supply machines, such as device connectivity, error existence, and the amount of feed or water remaining in the device. When the user wants to feed or when the scheduled time for feed arrives, the feed machine checks the error status and provides feed to the pet if there is no error. In a previous study, a mobile application that provides specific data about pets is already created using Blynk, but petification implemented a web-based pet IoT platform using Node-RED. MQTT also plays a major role in the data flow as a messaging protocol. In the database, messages, user information, device information, events to be detected, information on rules, and information on the feeding schedule designated by the user are stored.

\section{Introduction}
The pet care industry is a promising field. Profits from the pet industry increase every year, more than double the profit during 10 years, from \$48.4 billion in 2010 to \$109.6 billion in 2020[1?]. This is because the number of families owning pets is steadily increasing. Figure 1 shows that households owning a dog consists the largest portion, and the number of families owning dogs has increased from 46.3 million in 2011 to 69 million in 2021.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centerline{\includegraphics{fig 1.png}}
\caption{Number of U.S. Households That Own a Pet, by Type of Animal
}
\label{fig}
\end{figure}

 As the number of families raising pets increases, the number of pet owners with concern is increasing. They will worry about their pets when their pets are home alone, but there is no way for the owners to know whether their pet is doing well during that time.

A way to solve this problem is to receive data remotely about pets in the house at work. Specifically, the Internet of Things (IoT) solution will be a solution to this problem. IoT is a global infrastructure for the information society. IoT enables advanced services by interconnecting interoperable information and communication technologies [?].

Previous research on pet care IoT has continued like [3?][4?][5?]. Petcare IoT businesses already are operating in the market. Pet care IoT Businesses divided into the various field are operating such as health/activity monitor (FitBark [6?], PitPat [7?]), GPS tag(Pawscout [8?], Whistle [9?]),
pet monitor and interactive camera(Petcube [10?]), \textit{et al}.

 Among pet care IoT fields, this paper focuses on tracking pet’s water and feed consumption. The name of the proposed pet care IoT solution is 'Petification'. The name ‘petification’ was created by combining the words ‘pet’ and ‘notification’.
 
Petification provides various information to the owner about whether the pet is doing well while the owner is not home. Structurally, It is divided into device and software parts.

\subsection{Device}
The devices are largely divided into two types: a feed machine and a water supply machine. The feed machine is divided into a bowl part and a container part while the water supply machine is just one. Load cell sensors are installed under each part (for the feed machine, one under the container, one under the bowl. Under the water supply machine there is one load cell.). So a total of three load cell sensors was used. The reason for measuring the weight of the feed bowl and the feed container separately is because the weight of the bowl is required to know the feed intake, and the weight of the container is required to know the remaining amount of feed. The device's specific design is like fig 2. The servo motor is attached only to the feed container to control the amount of feed supplied. The edge device delivers data to the platform using Raspberry pi zero.

\subsection{Software}
When developers implement IoT services, platforms play an important role. The IoT platform is located in the middle of an IoT solution, facilitating the connection between multiple devices, and connecting platform users and devices. In other words, IoT platforms play a key role in building IoT ecosystems. Because of the importance of the IoT platforms, we decided to use Node-red because we planned on implementing a web-based IoT platform. 

In the entire petification IoT solution, the MQTT message broker also plays an important role. The MQTT message broker was used for efficient many-to-many communication and to manage the overall data flow in the platform. The MQTT is a protocol that sends messages using publishing and subscribing methods.

Petification's database is MySQL, and most of the data that MQTT messages send and receive by brokers is stored in MySQL.
Pet information data like how much food and water the pet consumed during the day are performed specific logic in the rule engine, then displayed as a graph on the Node-red dashboard.
\\

\section{Background}

 \subsection{Used Devices}
Devices used in feed machines and water supply machines are 5kg load cell sensors, weight sensor amplifiers(hx711), and Raspberry pi zeros.
The load cell sensor serves to convert the weight or force acting into an electrical signal. [?] 
Hx711 converts an analog signal into a digital signal, amplifies a measured value of a low load cell, and then transmits the value to another microcontroller. [?]
The converted and amplified data in hx711 is transmitted to the Raspberry pi. Then Raspberry pi receives this value and performs calibration.
\hfill \break
\indent Unlike the water supply machine, the feed machine uses a servo motor. This is because the feed has to be controlled by opening and closing the gate of the feed container. A servo motor was used as an actuator to open and close the gate. The servo motor is a rotary or linear actuator that rotates and pushes a machine. [?]

\subsection{Node-RED}
 
 Node-RED is a flow-based development tool that is easy for developers and non-developers to use visual programming, used to connect hardware devices, APIs, and online services [11?]. It is especially effective when it needs to be visualized quickly like API. Node-RED has operational strengths that it can run in various environments in local, Raspberry Pi, Docker, Cloud Instance, and \textit{et al}. Node-red is open-source and is being distributed through NPM, so you can utilize nodes or flows created by the user. It also has the advantage of being free and allowing users to customize nodes themselves. User interface (UI) can be configured using Node-RED's node-red-dashboard, and user-friendly UI can be conveniently configured through design changes using CSS and Javascript [12?]. In addition, many flows can configure the UI, and it is also possible to configure the UI using a third-party library such as React.js. Furthermore, Node-RED has the advantage of allowing users to directly access the database and manipulate data, and various modules can be used to send notifications to users. Node-RED is made by International Business Machines Corporation (IBM), and IBM plans to increase its contributor base as an open source for the sustainability of Node-RED. To raise the contributor base, IBM is planning to improve its easy-to-use testing framework, analyze code, and develop linter, which generates recommendations, warnings, and errors based on what it finds, \textit{et al} [13?].

\subsection{MQTT}
MQTT stands for Message Queuing Telemetry Transport and is the oldest Machine to Machine (M2M) protocol for IoT. It is an ISO standard Publishing-Subscribing-based messaging protocol designed for lightweight M2M communication in a limited network. All MQTT messages have their own topics, and MQTT clients can send and receive data by posting messages to MQTT  or subscribing to topics for those messages. TCP is used as a transport protocol, and TLS/SSL can be used for security. This means connection-oriented between Client-Brokers. In the MQTT protocol, three levels of quality of service (QoS) are used: QoS0(), QoS1(), and QoS2(). The MQTT protocol has a small message size and message overhead. In addition, due to low power consumption and resource consumption, it is evaluated as a suitable protocol for use in the IoT field.
[?]

\subsubsection{MQTT vs Other Protocols(CoAP, AMQP, HTTP)}
\hfill \break
In order to select the MQTT protocol, a comparative analysis was performed with other protocols.

\paragraph{MQTT vs CoAP}\hfill \break
CoAP uses UDP as a transport protocol, while MQTT uses TCP. The advantage of TCP-based protocols is that they guarantee packet delivery. On the other hand, UDP does not guarantee packet delivery. CoAP is also part of the WEB architecture. It is most suitable for devices that support UDP or UDP analog but is limited to several special types of IoT devices. On the other hand, MQTT deals with all cases within IoT.[?] 

\paragraph{MQTT vs AMQP}
\hfill \break
AMQP has higher reliability, security, provisioning, and interoperability than MQTT. For this reason, the size and overhead of the message are larger than MQTT.
The amount of power and the use of resources are very large. On the other hand, in the case of the MQTT protocol, the running device consumes little power.
Moreover, due to low overhead, MQTT is often used even in embedded environments for inter-machine communication. An example of using MQTT is a smart home.[?]
\paragraph{MQTT vs HTTP}
\hfill \break
HTTP has the maximum overhead and message size because it is designed for WEB, not IoT. This results in significant latency in Dataflow.
Furthermore, it was judged that the protocol in the IoT platform was inappropriate because the amount of power and resources used was larger than MQTT.[?]
Therefore, the MQTT protocol was judged to be suitable for the project in configuring message brokers. The message broker uses Mosquito, which implements the MQTT protocol.

\subsection{Mosquitto}
Mosquito is an open-source message broker implementing MQTT protocol versions 5.0, 3.1.1, and 3.1 and is provided by Eclipse. It is also lightweight and suitable for use in all devices, from low-power single-board computers to full servers.[?]

Several programs are implementing MQTT, such as EMQ, HiveMQ, Mosquito, and VerneMQ. A study comparing each of the programs suggested that in situations where availability is not significant, using Single Broker and Persistence Setting is a simpler way to configure Message Broker than using clustered Broker [?]. In addition, in the context of using Persistence Setting in Single Broker, Mosquitto had close to 0 percent probability of message loss and message order mixing, and the probability of receiving duplicate messages was significantly lower than other programs[?]. Thus, this research uses Mosquitto with persistency setting as a single message broker.

\subsection{MySQL}
MySQL is a fast, flexible, and easy-to-use database with RDBMS (relational database management system). The combination of MySQL's secure processing and reliable software provides effective transactions for large projects, so it is flexible with open sources. MySQL is also excellent in terms of data security because it is evaluated as having the safest and most reliable database management system [?]. In addition, MySQL is considered a suitable database to manage effective data flows because it has good compatibility with Node-RED [?].


\section{Related Literature}
In this chapter, We will divide the previous studies into device and software aspects. Previous studies are compared with petification's devices and software.

\subsection{Device}
In the previous study conducted by P. N. Vrishanka \textit{et al.} [?
% `P. N. Vrishanka, P. Prabhakar, D. Shet and K. Rupali, "Automated Pet Feeder using IoT," 2021 IEEE International Conference on Mobile Networks and Wireless Communications (ICMNWC), 2021, pp. 1-5, DOI: 10.1109/ICMNWC52512.2021.9688391.`
], ultrasonic distance sensor and SG90 servo motor were mounted to Arduino Uno R3. An ultrasonic distance sensor is to determine the remaining feed amount by measuring the distance from the entrance of the feed container to the inside of the bowl. SG90 servo motor is for providing the feed to the pet by rotating certain degrees.

However, the feed machine of petification used load cell sensors to obtain the measurement of bowl and container weight, because it is difficult to use ultrasonic waves to measure the amount of feed accurately. The petification feed machine uses Raspberry pi zero and uses an MG90S micro servo motor to open and close the feed gate. 

 In the previous study conducted by Rogerio Nogueira \textit{et al}, [11
% Robot Chow: Automatic Animal Feeding with Intelligent Interface to Monitor Pets (IJAERS, 2019)
] , Rotary Valve and DC motor were used to provide feed.

And in the previous study conducted by Vania \textit{et al}, [?
% Vania, K. Karyono and I. H. T. Nugroho, "Smart dog feeder design using wireless communication, MQTT and Android client," 2016 International Conference on Computer, Control, Informatics and its Applications (IC3INA), 2016, pp. 191-196, DOI: 10.1109/IC3INA.2016.7863048.
], propeller blade and DC motor were used.

However, the problem with using a rotary valve or propeller blade is that the feed can’t be provided with the exact weight. This is because the amount of feed to be provided to the pet should be determined based on the serving unit contained in one space. Thus, when the feed machine tries to provide a certain weight of feed with the rotary valve or propeller blade, there is always the possibility of providing more than the intended weight, even if the error for load cell is not concerned.

The petification feed machine does not use a rotary valve but uses a gate that can block the feeder container outlet because it has the advantage of being able to adjust the amount of feed to be supplied in more detail than the rotary valve method.

In addition, both [11] and [?
% Vania, K. Karyono and I. H. T. Nugroho, "Smart dog feeder design using wireless communication, MQTT and Android client," 2016 International Conference on Computer, Control, Informatics and its Applications (IC3INA), 2016, pp. 191-196, DOI: 10.1109/IC3INA.2016.7863048.
] uses a DC motor to provide feed through continuous rotation of the rotary valve. However, the feed machine of petification uses a servo motor because they need more precise control than free continuous rotation.[?]

] 
implement a pet care IoT solution that visualizes the daily food consumption in real-time and automatically feeds the pet according to the scheduled time. It was developed using “Blynk” as an IoT platform.

But, non of the two studies above provide information on device status. Although tracking water and feed consumption is an important feature in pet care IoT solutions, keeping track of IoT devices’ status is also an important feature. Petification provides the status of feed machines and water supply machines, such as device connectivity, error existence, and the amount of feed or water remaining in the device. Moreover, petification provides an error notification feature that notifies users when the error occurred, such as when water or feed is empty, and when the device is disconnected unexpectedly.

From the platform perspective, the above two studies commonly used “Blynk” as an IoT platform. However, petification uses Node-RED instead of Blynk to take advantage of visual programming, openly pre-developed flows and nodes, and various notification means.

\section{Methodology}
The methodology part will be explained by dividing it into the block used for petification and the message flow. The IoT solution of petification is largely divided into three parts: device, platform, and user. This research is conducted with a focus on the development of devices and platforms. The main blocks used in each of the three parts will be described first and a flowchart will be explained.

\subsection{Blocks}
The platform for this research consists of 8 blocks: MQTT Message Broker and Database are running on independent processes, while MQTT Manager, Rule Engine, Device Manager, User Manager, Schedule Engine, and UI Dashboard Manager are running on Node-RED. As a pet-care IoT solution, 2 Devices are attached to the platform: Fee machine and water supply machine. The user of the solution can access the dashboard which visually provides pet data, and they can receive malfunction alerts via E-Mail and/or WhatsApp. Figure 2 shows the overall structure for the proposed pet-care IoT solution.
\begin{figure}[htbp]

\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{platform overall flow.png}}
\caption{Petification overall Structure.}
\label{fig}
\end{figure}

Figure 2 shows the structure and relationship of the pet care platform blocks, devices, and user interface.
\subsubsection{MQTT Message Broker}
\hfill \break This research was conducted with MQTT Protocol to control the message flow. Thus, Mosquitto v1.4.15 was installed and running on the platform server to act as an MQTT Message Broker. Feed machine, water supply machine, and Node-RED are connected to the MQTT Message Broker as a client, and MQTT Message Broker mediates Node-RED to Device communication and reverse-way communication (Device to Node-RED).

\subsubsection{Database}
\hfill \break To store data efficiently and safely, a Database block is included in the platform. As a Database block, MySQL v5.7.37 is installed and running on the platform server. The database stores various data, such as all the MQTT messages (in a Time-series Data Table), message-based action execution rules (in a Rule Table), information for the connected devices (in a Device Table), user information (in a User Table), time-based action execution rules (in a Schedule Table), and daily statistic information (in a Statistic Table).

\subsubsection{MQTT Manager}
\hfill \break MQTT Manager in the Node-RED is the gateway for MQTT messages to enter Node-RED. The main purpose of this block is to convert incoming MQTT messages to give convenience to other Node-RED-based blocks. To achieve it, this block receives all the messages by subscribing to all the MQTT message topics. And then it parses message topic and payload to provide useful information such as the username of the MQTT session and client id. These pieces of information are used in other Node-RED-based nodes in further progress.

\subsubsection{Rule Engine}
\hfill \break The purpose of Rule Engine is to activate actions according to MQTT messages. It cooperates with the Rule Table of Database to activate the action. When one message is published, Rule Engine searches Rule Table to figure out which actions should be activated and activates them. Actions are defined as ReST API form, thus activating action will be progressed as sending an HTTP request. It also provides ReST APIs for adding, modifying, and deleting rules. Some ReST APIs for actions are defined in another block, whereas some APIs are defined in Rule Engine, such as updating consumption and sending notifications.

\subsubsection{Device Manager}
\hfill \break Handling devices that are attached by users is the main purpose of the Device Manager block. It provides ReST APIs that can add a new device to the platform (with HTTP POST method), modify the status of the device (with HTTP PATCH method), and delete a device (with HTTP DELETE method).

\subsubsection{User Manager}
\hfill \break The purpose of the User Manager block is to provide modifying user settings. Users can manage these 4 settings: Notification, Email address, WhatsApp information, and timezone where the user lives. The reason for requiring timezone is to support multi-country users. As managing the schedule is done with the platform, all the schedules are stored in the Database with UTC. Thus timezone for the user is needed to convert user’s schedule. All the settings above will be provided with the ReST API form.

\subsubsection{Schedule Engine}
\hfill \break Handling and executing schedule is the main functionality for this block. For schedule execution, it cooperates with the Schedule Table in the Database. Every minute, the Schedule Engine checks the Schedule Table and executes the actions that are scheduled to be activated at that time. Also, this block provides ReST APIs that can create, read, update and delete the schedule.

\subsubsection{UI Dashboard Manager}
\hfill \break Dashboard Manager is to provide Graphical User Interface (GUI) to the user. By using this block, users can be provided the status of water and food remaining and consumption visually. It also provides buttons to serve food and input areas to set user settings.


\subsection{Flow chart}
% 이 프로젝트의 주요 기능 3가지에 대한 플로우를 설명한다. 느낌
\subsubsection{Flow 1}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{FlowChart_1.jpg}}
\caption{Petification flow chart 1.}
\label{fig}
\end{figure}
The load cell sensor measures the value first and converts the measured value into weight. After that, the three flows proceed in parallel. The first is to update the remaining feed. The second is to update the feed intake and the third is to update the device status.
The remaining feed and device status are immediately displayed on the dashboard, and the feed intake is deducted from the feed amount recorded in the past. If the result is positive, this means that the past record is larger, meaning that the pet consumed feed.
If the resulting value is negative or 0, it means that the current record is larger, meaning that the pet did not consume the feed. Therefore, the resulting value comes to zero. In other cases, it is treated as '?'. For example, It is impossible to calculate when there is no previous result value or only the current result value exists. In these cases, data is updated on the table every day and displayed on the dashboard. This overall flow is repeated every 15 seconds.

\hfill \break
\subsubsection{Flow 2}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{FlowChart_2.png}}
\caption{Petification flow chart 2.}
\label{fig}
\end{figure}
The second flow starts when the serve button is pressed or when the previously scheduled serving time is compared with the current time.
First, measure the weight of the container, then determine whether the container contains feed or is empty. If the container is empty, publish the error message. Then go back to the beginning and wait for a minute.
In the opposite case, if the container is not empty, operate the servo motor to open the container gate. From this point on, the weight of the bowl continues to be measured, and if the weight of the bowl does not change, the error that the gate has a problem will be published, and flow return to wait for a minute.
If the weight of the current bowl is less than the target weight, the cycle is repeated

while waiting 0.1 seconds. When the current weight and target weight are greater or equal, the servo motor is operated to close the container gate. This is the serving success path and will return to the beginning and wait for another minute.

\hfill \break
\subsubsection{Flow3}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{FlowChart_3.png}}
\caption{Petification flow chart 3.}
\label{fig}
\end{figure}
When the device publishes an error message, two flows proceed in parallel. One is to store the current status in the DB and the other is to send an error notification.
Storing flow ends with simply storing current status in the DB, however, sending error notification is not.
First, the status of the device currently stored in the DB is checked. And then, if Status is "connected", it moves on to the next step. If not, or if the status is already an error, ignore the error message. After that, check the notification setting of the device owner. If the notification setting is "on", prepare and send an e-mail and/or a message on whatsapp. If "off", ignore the error message.
